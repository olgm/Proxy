# Changelog

## Unreleased

- `proxyd`: config-driven relay node. Handshake rewrite (Forge markers preserved,
  BungeeCord identity stripped), source-IP allowlist, `splice(2)` relay with
  per-direction half-close, legacy `0xFE` ping rejected.
- `proxyctl`: topology-driven deployer over ssh/scp. Derives every node config from
  one file, cross-compiles per node arch, installs a hardened systemd unit running as
  an unprivileged account.
- `proxyctl deploy` verifies every link after installing, probes the target's
  firewall when one is blocked, and offers to open exactly that port. Never edits a
  firewall without being asked.
- `tools/mcping`: status-ping client for checking a chain end to end. Outside the
  deploy path; build and copy it by hand.
- `tools/tcpping`: TCP round-trip timing, with a `-listen` mode so any node can be a
  target. Measures what proxyd carries instead of what ICMP reports. Outside the
  deploy path.
- Measured a candidate second Tokyo node (ty-a `nrt`, `vc2-1c-1gb`): 20 ICMP echoes
  from each existing node, 0% loss, HK 44.6 ms avg and Chicago 136.1 ms avg. Node was
  provisioned and destroyed on 2026-09-01; no topology refers to it and its IP is back
  in ty-a's pool.
- Pinned the Tailscale underlay to IPv4 on the HK↔Tokyo link, which had negotiated an
  IPv6 path costing 2.5 ms avg and 8.3 ms mdev against 0.5 ms on IPv4. Tokyo↔Chicago
  needed nothing: Chicago has no public IPv6. With both legs on IPv4 the chain is
  167.5 ms p50 over Tailscale against 167.9 ms over public IPv4, so transport is now a
  wash and the choice is about dependencies, not latency.
- Verified HK → Tokyo → Chicago → Hypixel: status ping returns Hypixel's MOTD while
  the client claims an unrelated hostname, and all three hops appear in the socket
  table. Real client login through the chain confirmed working.
